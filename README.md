This source code is to help you learn by
viewing examples of the source code.
it's much faster to learn from examples.
Anything is possible!

here are some examples for you.
I created 2 AI reinforced learning algorithms
Wednesday August 9th 4:05pm 2023 I'm putting it here 
for posterity sake.

1: Bellman
Q(s, a) = R(s, a) + γ * max_a Q(s', a')

2: rainmanp7 1st attempt modified.
wi = (wi0 / (1 + (dij / τ))) * (1 + α * Ps + β * T + γ * M + δ * V)

3: rainmanp7 2nd Final attempt.
wi = (wi0 / (1 + (dij / τ))) * (1 + α * Ps + β * T + γ * M + δ * V + ε * MA + ζ * C + η * S + θ * Si)
