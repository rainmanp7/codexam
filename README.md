here are some examples for you.
I created 2 AI reinforced learning algorithms
Wednesday August 9th 4:05pm 2023 I'm putting it here 
for posterity sake.

1: Bellman
Q(s, a) = R(s, a) + γ * max_a Q(s', a')

2: rainmanp7 1st attempt modified.
wi = (wi0 / (1 + (dij / τ))) * (1 + α * Ps + β * T + γ * M + δ * V)

rainmanp7 Improvised 2nd of 1st edition.


Here's an enhanced version tailored for language learning:

wi = (wi0 / (1 + (dij / τ))) * (1 + α * Ps + β * T + γ * M + δ * V)


where:
- wi: The updated weight for the state i, representing the strength of language learning in that state.
- wi0: The initial weight for the state i.
- dij: The distance between the current state i and its neighboring state j.
- τ: A parameter controlling the strength of the distance effect on the weight update.
- Ps: The effectiveness of positive self-talk for language learning in the current state i.
- T: The linear timeline component representing the progression of language learning for the current state i.
- α, β, γ, δ: Parameters controlling the influence of different aspects on the weight update.

Now, let's explain the added modifications:

1. γ * M: Mnemonics effectiveness for language learning in the current state i. This component incorporates the use of memory aids and mnemonic techniques to facilitate vocabulary retention and grammar rules understanding.

2. δ * V: Visual cues involvement for language learning in the current state i. This aspect integrates visual aids, such as images, videos, or flashcards, to enhance language comprehension and association.

By introducing these additional aspects, the equation is now more tailored for language learning. Positive self-talk, linear timelines, mnemonics, and visual cues are all incorporated to create a strong and beautiful equation that supports the language acquisition process. The parameters α, β, γ, and δ can be adjusted to fine-tune the equation's behavior based on the specific language learning context and individual learner preferences.

3: rainmanp7 2nd Final attempt.

wi = (wi0 / (1 + (dij / τ))) * (1 + α * Ps + β * T + γ * M + δ * V + ε * MA + ζ * C + η * S + θ * Si)


where:
- wi: The updated weight for the state i.
- wi0: The initial weight for the state i.
- dij: The distance between the current state i and its neighboring state j.
- τ: A parameter controlling the strength of the distance effect on the weight update.
- Ps: The effectiveness of positive self-talk for the current state i.
- T: The linear timeline component representing the progression of learning for the current state i.
- α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ: Parameters controlling the influence of different aspects on the weight update.

The additional elements from the list are incorporated as follows:

- M: Mnemonics effectiveness for the current state i.
- V: Visual cues involvement for the current state i.
- MA: Multi-sensory approach incorporation for the current state i.
- C: Keeping concepts concrete for the current state i.
- S: Utilizing similarities more familiar to achieve the goal for the current state i.
- Si: Example solutions provided for the current state i.

By incorporating these aspects, the equation becomes more comprehensive and allows for a holistic approach to learning. Each parameter (α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ) can be tuned to control the influence of the corresponding aspect on the weight update, making the learning process more efficient and effective.
